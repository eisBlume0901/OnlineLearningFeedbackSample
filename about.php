                The pandemic has brought students to a standstill. The education system has been disrupted.
                The students are unable to attend their classes. The online class learning is a platform that
                provides students with the opportunity to learn from the comfort of their homes.
                Bluebell University designed this feedback form to help educators understand if online class learning
                should be still implemented despite that we are slowly transitioning to face-to-face classes once again.
                Rest assured that all the information you will provide will be kept confidential.
