include vs require in PHP

include and require are both used to include a file in the current file.
The difference is that if the file is not found, include will only produce
a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue, while require will produce
a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script.

include - warning error (the script can still be executed)
require - compilation error (completely stop the script)

USE CASE
include
Use it when the file is not critical to the script execution.
Counter part in Java: import

require
Use it when the file is critical to the script execution.
Good practice to use require when including files that contain functions or classes.
Counter part in Java: import
