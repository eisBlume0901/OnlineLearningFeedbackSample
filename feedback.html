                In my case, I am more productive when I am in the classroom.
                I am not saying that online class learning is not effective.
                It is just that I am more focused when I am in the classroom.
                I am more motivated to learn. I am more engaged in the discussion.
                I am more participative in the activities. I am more attentive to the teacher.

                I am more comfortable when I am at home because I can focus without any distractions.
                I can manage my time well. I can do other things after my class. Online class learning is effective
                for me.

                Hybrid learning is the best for me. I can learn from the classroom and at home. At school, I can
                clarify my questions with my teacher. At home, I can do my homework and study for my exams. Students
                should be given more freedom to choose how they want to learn after all every student are unique.
